## Test-Driven Development - Roman Numerals

The project was created to practice TDD approach.

You can find the requirements in the following link: https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals.

For development method which convert integers to Roman is used the RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle.

Write one failing test first and write the simplest code to make that test pass,
then see if there is any opportunity to refactor. 
If not, move onto writing your next test and follow the cycle through as you build up the solution.
